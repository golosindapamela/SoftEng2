 * Program Title: SariwAI Mobile Application
 * Programmers: Abesamis, John Gabriel R.
 *              David, Abdurasheed A.
 *              Golosinda, Pamela T.
 *              Supnet, Kieferson Carl G.
 * Where the program fits: Frontend - This file is the main entry point for the Flutter application.
 * Date written: 2025-06-20
 * Date revised: 2025-10-10
 * Purpose: This file initializes the entire Flutter application. It sets up the root
 *          widget (MyApp), defines global application themes (like fonts and colors),
 *          and configures the named navigation routes that allow users to move
 *          between different screens.
 * Data structures, algorithms, and control:
 *          - Data Structures: A Map<String, WidgetBuilder> is used to define the named routes
 *                            for screen navigation.
 *          - Control Flow: The runApp() function inflates the root widget and attaches it to
 *                          the screen, starting the application's lifecycle. Navigation is
 *                          handled by the MaterialApp widget's routing system.
