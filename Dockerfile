#  Program Title: Dockerfile – Tilapia Freshness Detection API
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Programmers: Abesamis, John Gabriel R.
#               David, Abdurasheed A.
#               Golosinda, Pamela T.
#               Supnet, Kieferson Carl G.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Where the program fits: This Dockerfile defines the containerized environment for the
#                          backend API that performs tilapia freshness detection using a
#                          transformer-based object detection model.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Date written: 2025-06-20
#  Date revised: 2025-10-10
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Purpose: This file describes the steps required to build a secure, efficient, and
#           production-ready Docker image for the Flask-based backend server. It uses
#           a multi-stage build to reduce final image size, improve performance, and
#           ensure clean dependency separation.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Data structures, algorithms, and control:
#           - Data Structures: Docker layers and build stages organize dependencies and
#                             application code. Environment variables store configuration.
#           - Algorithms: Implements a multi-stage build process—first building a virtual
#                         environment in a 'builder' stage, then copying only necessary
#                         components into a minimal final image.
#           - Control Flow: The build process sequentially installs dependencies, copies
#                          source code, sets up a non-root user, configures environment
#                          variables, exposes the API port, and defines the Gunicorn
#                          command executed when the container starts.

# --- Stage 1: Builder ---
# In this stage, we install all dependencies, including any that are only
# needed to build the application (e.g., compilers). This keeps the
# final image smaller.
FROM python:3.9-slim AS builder

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Set environment variables to improve build efficiency and security
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Copy only the requirements file first to leverage Docker's build cache.
# This step will only be re-run if requirements.txt changes.
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies into a virtual environment within the builder stage.
# Using --no-cache-dir reduces layer size. The --prefix option makes the
# environment portable, so we can copy it to the next stage.
RUN python -m venv /opt/venv
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# --- Stage 2: Final Image ---
# This is the actual image that will be deployed. It is built to be as
# small and secure as possible.
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory for the final image
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the virtual environment with all installed dependencies from the builder stage.
# This is much faster and more reliable than running pip install again.
COPY --from=builder /opt/venv /opt/venv

# Copy the application source code into the final image.
# This step happens after dependency installation, so changes to the code
# won't cause the dependencies to be re-installed.
COPY . .

# Create a non-root user to run the application for better security.
# The application code is copied before this, so we can set correct ownership.
RUN useradd -m -u 1000 user && chown -R user:user /app
USER user

# Set the environment variables for the final container.
# This ensures the application uses the correct Python environment and cache directory.
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"
ENV TRANSFORMERS_CACHE="/home/user/.cache"

# Expose the port the application will run on. This is good practice for documentation.
EXPOSE 7860

# The command to run the application using Gunicorn.
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:7860", "app:app"]
